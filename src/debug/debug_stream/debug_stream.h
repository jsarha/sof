/*
 * Debug Stream is a stream protocol for passing real-time debug
 * information from SOF system. It provides the framework for
 * passing pieces of abstract data objects from DSP side to host side
 * debugging tools.
 *
 * The details of Debug Stream protocol varies depending on transfer
 * method, but the stream should always start with a header that
 * consists of DEBUG_STREAM_IDENTIFIER and header size.
 */

struct debug_stream_hdr {
	uint32_t magic;		/* Magic number to recognize stream start */
	uint32_t hdr_size;	/* Header size */
};

/*
 * After the header ('hdr_size' bytes from beginning of 'magic') the a
 * stream of Debug Stream records should follow. Each record will
 * start with a record identifier and record size, after which the
 * record payload will follow.
 *
 * The abstract data is application specific and is passed from DSP
 * debug entity to user space debug tool for decoding and
 * presentation. The data is recognized by the 'id' and the 'size'
 * describes the amount of data. The 'serial' is a running number of sent
 * record, increased by one after each record. The protocol is
 * agnostic about the contents of the records.
