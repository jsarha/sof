/*
 * This file describes how Debug Stream can be transported over debug
 * window memory slot. The debug stream is an abstract media API for
 * passing debug data records from SOF DSP to the host system for
 * presentation. The debug stream records are described in debug_stream.h.
 *
 * This example describes how Debug Stream data is transferred from
 * DSP to host side using a debug memory window slot. To learn more
 * see soc/intel/intel_adsp/common/include/adsp_debug_window.h
 * under Zephyr source tree.
 *
 * DEBUG_STREAM slot is reserved from SRAM window and a header is
 * written in the beginning of the slot. The header is a static data
 * structure that is initialized once at DSP boot time. All elements
 * in bellow example are 32-bit unsigned integers:
 *
 *      --------------------------------------------------  ---
 *      | id = DEBUG_STREAM_IDENTIFIER                   |   |
 *      | total_size = 4096                              | 64 bytes
 *      | num_sections = CONFIG_MP_MAX_NUM_CPUS *        |   |
 *      | <padding>                                      |   |

 *      | section_descriptor [] = {                      |   |
 *      |   {                                            |   |
 *      |      core_id = 0                               |   |
 *      |      size = 1344                               | 64 bytes
 *      |      offset = 64                               |   |
 *      |   }                                            |   |
 *      | <padding>                                      |   |
 *      --------------------------------------------------  ---
 *      |   {                                            |   |
 *      |      core_id = 1                               |   |
 *      |      size = 1344                               | 64 bytes
 *      |      offset = 1344+64                          |   |
 *      |   }                                            |   |
 *      | <padding>                                      |   |
 *      --------------------------------------------------  ---
 *      |   {                                            |   |
 *      |      core_id = 2                               |   |
 *      |      size = 1344                               | 64 bytes
 *      |      offset = 2*1344+64                        |   |
 *      |   }                                            |   |
 *      | }                                              |   |
 *      | <padding>                                      |   |

 *   * CONFIG_MP_MAX_NUM_CPUS is 3 in this example
 *
 * The header contains generic information like identifier, total
 * size, and number of sections. After the generic fields there is an
 * array of section descriptors. Each array element is cacheline
 * aligned. The array has 'num_sections' number of elements. Each
 * element in the array describes a circular buffer, one for each DSP
 * core.
 *
 * The remaining memory in the debug window slot is divided between
 * those sections. The buffers are not necessarily of equal size, like
 * in this example. The circular buffers are all cache line aligned,
 * 64 in this example. One section looks like this:
 *
 *      --------------------------------------------------  ---
 *      | next_seqno = <counter for written objects>     |   |
 *      | w_ptr = <write position in 32-bit words>       | 1344 bytes
 *      | buffer_data[1344/4-2] = {                      |   |
 *      |    <debug data records>                        |   |
 *      | }                                              |   |
 *      --------------------------------------------------  ---
 *
 * The data records are described in debug_strem.h. In the case of
 * debug window memory slot the next record should always be aligned
 * to word (4-byte) boundary.
 *
 * The debug stream writes the records of abstract data to the
 * circular buffer, and updates the w_ptr when the record is
 * completely written. The host side receiver tries to keep up with the
 * w_ptr and keeps track of its read position. The size of the record
 * is written - again - after each record and before the next. This is
 * to allow parsing the stream backwards in an overrun recovery
 * situation. The w_ptr value is updated last, when the record is
 * completely written.
